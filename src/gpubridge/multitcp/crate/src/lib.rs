//! Multi-stream TCP messaging for gpubridge's `bridge="multitcp"` (docs/RUST_TRANSPORT.md).
//!
//! A [`Worker`] is one bridge member's end: a listening socket, and `streams` TCP
//! connections to every other member (the member with the lower index dials). A message
//! is a tagged byte range in the caller's memory. It travels as one frame (a 16-byte
//! header, the tag and the length, then the bytes) on one of that peer's connections,
//! chosen round-robin, so consecutive messages to one peer go out in parallel. Every
//! connection has its own sending and receiving thread; bytes go straight from the
//! sender's memory to the socket and from the socket into the receiver's memory.
//!
//! A receive is matched by (peer, tag), and must be posted before the frame can be read:
//! a frame whose receive isn't posted yet waits for it, holding back its connection, not
//! the others. Python numbers its messages so tags never repeat within a collective, and
//! posts a collective's receives before waiting on any of them.
//!
//! A wait that fails (a timeout, a broken connection, a frame of the wrong size) first
//! stops the worker: every connection is shut down and every thread joined, so once the
//! error reaches the caller no thread can read or write the caller's memory again, and
//! the buffers of the failed collective can be freed. `gb_tcp_abort` does the same when
//! the caller fails on its own between posting and waiting.
//!
//! The C functions below are what gpubridge.multitcp loads with ctypes. Every one catches
//! panics, so a bug here can't unwind into Python. Not thread-safe across callers: one
//! Python thread drives a worker, as the bridge does.
