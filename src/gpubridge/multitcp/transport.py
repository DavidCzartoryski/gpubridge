"""``bridge="multitcp"``: the island leaders' bridge over several TCP connections per pair.

Opt-in (docs/RUST_TRANSPORT.md). The Rust library in :mod:`gpubridge.multitcp`
moves tagged byte ranges between leaders over ``GPUBRIDGE_MULTITCP_STREAMS``
connections per pair (4 by default), each with its own sending and receiving
thread; this module runs the collectives and the reductions, with torch ops,
like the UCX transport. It takes host tensors only (``device_tensors`` is
False), so GPU tensors reach it through the policies' usual staging and their
stream ordering is untouched. The collectives are :class:`gpubridge.tagged.TaggedBridge`'s
(shared with ``bridge="verbs"``), in chunks of ``GPUBRIDGE_MULTITCP_CHUNK_BYTES``
(4 MiB by default) spread over the connections.

The reductions run on one torch thread (the thread count is set for the collective and
restored after). On a node with few CPUs, torch's intra-op threads would otherwise
compete with this transport's network threads: on Explorer's 4-CPU jobs that made each
chunk's reduction 10 to 25 times slower than on one thread. Gloo's own bridge reduces
on one thread too.

The leaders connect on the address of ``GPUBRIDGE_MULTITCP_IFNAME``, else of
``GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME``, else the one this machine reaches ``MASTER_ADDR`` from.
Every wait has the deadline ``init()`` gave its groups; a timeout or a failed
peer raises, and the transport refuses later calls. Before anything raises out of
a collective, the library's threads are stopped, so none of them can still write
into (or read from) the collective's tensors once the caller sees the error.
